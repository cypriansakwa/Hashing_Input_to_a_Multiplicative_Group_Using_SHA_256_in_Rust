## Overview
This Rust program demonstrates how to hash an input into a multiplicative group modulo a prime number using SHA-256 as the hash function. The hashed value is reduced to fit within the range of valid elements of the multiplicative group, i.e., between 
$1$ and $p-1$, where $p$ is the prime number. The prime number used must be large enough to avoid collisions and ensure security when using this in cryptographic applications.
## How it Works
- **SHA-256 Hashing:**
   - The input is hashed using the SHA-256 hash function to produce a 32-byte (256-bit) output.
- **Modular Reduction:**
   - The resulting hash is translated to a big integer, which is reduced modulo $p-1$, where $p$ is a huge prime. This assures that the output is a legitimate element in the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_n^\*$, which consists of numbers from $1$ to $p-1$ that are coprime with $p$.
- **Offset:**
  - To ensure that the result is not zero, $1$ is added after executing the modulo operation, ensuring that the group element lies in the range $[1,p−1]$.
## Steps:
1. **Input Hashing:**
   - The input data is hashed using SHA-256, and the resulting hash is converted from hexadecimal format into a large integer.
2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The hash is reduced modulo $p−1$, where $p$ is the provided prime number, ensuring the result fits within the range of valid elements in the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_n^\*$.
3. **Result:**
   - The program prints the resulting group element.
## Requirements
- Rust installed on your machine. (If Rust is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it).
- `num-bigint` crate for handling large integers.
- `sha2` crate for the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
- `num-traits` crate for converting between types.
- `hex` crate for encoding/decoding hexadecimal strings.

## Example
This example hashes the input string `"let input = b"Hello, Multiplicative Group!"` and maps the resulting hash to a multiplicative group modulo the prime `340282366920938463463374607431768211507` (a large 128-bit prime).

## Input:
>```
>let input = b"Hello, Multiplicative Group!";
## Output
   - The program outputs a valid element from the multiplicative group defined by the prime number $p$:
   >```
   >   Hashed to multiplicative group: <group element>
### Modifying the Input
- You can change the input string by modifying the input variable. For example:
>```
>let input = b"Your new input here!";

## Functionality
- `hash_to_multiplicative_group`
This function hashes the input data and ensures the result is a valid element in the multiplicative group mod a prime number.
   - **Parameters:**
      - `input`: A byte slice that represents the data to be hashed.
      - `prime`: A `BigUint` representing the prime number used to define the multiplicative group.
   - **Return Value**: A `BigUint` representing the resulting group element.
